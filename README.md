# hbot

**IRC bot which sole purpose is to watch dokuwiki's recent changes for updates and inform us on IRC channel.**

https://github.com/hacxman/hbot

**Known deficits:**

* bot has to be highlighted every time when issuing commands.
* bot cannot recognize more than one update in a given timestamp (1 minute)

Bot itself is modelled after http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1785 with some mods.  
There is a primitive support for extending bot with commands and periodic tasks.

Of course it's written in Ruby,  
*Enjoy!*
