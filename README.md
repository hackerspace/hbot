# hbot

**IRC bot which sole purpose is to spam the channel with user defined message.**

https://github.com/hackerspace/hbot/tree/announce

Bot itself is modelled after http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1785 with some mods.
There is a primitive support for extending bot with commands and periodic tasks.

Of course it's written in Ruby,
*Enjoy!*
